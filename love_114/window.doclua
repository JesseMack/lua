["love.window.fromPixels"] = [=[fromPixels(pixelvalue) - Converts a number from pixels to density-independent units.

The pixel density inside the window might be greater (or smaller) than the 'size' of the window. For example on a retina screen in Mac OS X with the highdpi window flag enabled, the window may take up the same physical size as an 800x600 window, but the area inside the window uses 1600x1200 pixels. love.window.fromPixels(1600) would return 800 in that case.

This function converts coordinates from pixels to the size users are expecting them to display at onscreen. love.window.toPixels does the opposite. The highdpi window flag must be enabled to use the full pixel density of a Retina screen on Mac OS X and iOS. The flag currently does nothing on Windows and Linux, and on Android it is effectively always enabled.

Most LÖVE functions return values and expect arguments in terms of pixels rather than density-independent units.]=],

The pixel density inside the window might be greater (or smaller) than the 'size' of the window. For example on a retina screen in Mac OS X with the highdpi window flag enabled, the window may take up the same physical size as an 800x600 window, but the area inside the window uses 1600x1200 pixels. love.window.getDPIScale() would return 2.0 in that case.

The love.window.fromPixels and love.window.toPixels functions can also be used to convert between units.

The window position is in the coordinate space of the display it is currently in.]=],

["love.window.isDisplaySleepEnabled"] = [=[isDisplaySleepEnabled() - Gets whether the display is allowed to sleep while the program is running.

Display sleep is disabled by default. Some types of input (e.g. joystick button presses) might not prevent the display from sleeping, if display sleep is allowed.]=],
["love.window.isMaximized"] = [=[isMaximized() - Gets whether the Window is currently maximized.

The window can be maximized if it is not fullscreen and is resizable, and either the user has pressed the window's Maximize button or love.window.maximize has been called.]=],

["love.window.isOpen"] = [=[isOpen() - Checks if the window is open.]=],

The window is considered visible if it's not minimized and the program isn't hidden.]=],
["love.window.maximize"] = [=[maximize() - Makes the window as large as possible.

This function has no effect if the window isn't resizable, since it essentially programmatically presses the window's 'maximize' button.]=],
["love.window.minimize"] = [=[minimize() - Minimizes the window to the system's task bar / dock.]=],
["love.window.requestAttention"] = [=[requestAttention(continuous) - Causes the window to request the attention of the user if it is not in the foreground.

In Windows the taskbar icon will flash, and in OS X the dock icon will bounce.]=],

["love.window.setDisplaySleepEnabled"] = [=[setDisplaySleepEnabled(enable) - Sets whether the display is allowed to sleep while the program is running.

Display sleep is disabled by default. Some types of input (e.g. joystick button presses) might not prevent the display from sleeping, if display sleep is allowed.]=],
["love.window.setFullscreen"] = [=[setFullscreen(fullscreen) - Enters or exits fullscreen. The display to use when entering fullscreen is chosen based on which display the window is currently in, if multiple monitors are connected.]=],
["love.window.setIcon"] = [=[setIcon(imagedata) - Sets the window icon until the game is quit. Not all operating systems support very large icon images.]=],
["love.window.setMode"] = [=[setMode(width, height, flags) - Sets the display mode and properties of the window.

If width or height is 0, setMode will use the width and height of the desktop. 

Changing the display mode may have side effects: for example, canvases will be cleared and values sent to shaders with canvases beforehand or re-draw to them afterward if you need to.]=],
["love.window.setPosition"] = [=[setPosition(x, y, displayindex) - Sets the position of the window on the screen.

The window position is in the coordinate space of the specified display.]=],

["love.window.updateMode"] = [=[updateMode(width, height, settings) - Sets the display mode and properties of the window, without modifying unspecified properties.

If width or height is 0, updateMode will use the width and height of the desktop. 

Changing the display mode may have side effects: for example, canvases will be cleared. Make sure to save the contents of canvases beforehand or re-draw to them afterward if you need to.]=],
